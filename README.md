# RO Mobile: Eternal Love Rune Simulator
Project to convert rune names and descriptions on original calculator to SEA server version in English.
Also includes some UI cleanup and any various other features/changes I feel like adding.

SEA version is currently only EP 3.0 so some runes will be different from original calculator as they reflect 3.0 decriptions and abilities.
Third Classes are also NOT in SEA server yet, so I will hold off on adding translations for these skills for now. However, I will keep them enabled so you can play with them if you want.
In the future I would like to include ability to select EP version and show rune data and available classes for that EP only.


Original version by RoMELDE found here: https://github.com/RoMELDE/RuneBFS
All rune data rights belong to XinDong.


### New Features & changes
- Display stats from selected/saved runes in table format
- Default to Ep 3.0 class (trans second class)
- Version info will reflect client version data is based on

 
### Todo / wishlist features

- Display Special Runes & counts in selected/saved table
- Sort selected/saved totals
- Make ALL text use Language Select in UI instead of being hardcoded to a specific language.
- Add translations for other languages as requested and provided by other users.
- Add ability to select EP version?
- Ability to save and import builds? (sort of already exists through url)
